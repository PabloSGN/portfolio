My thesis revolved around the calibration and operation of a Spectropolarimeter that flew aboard a Solar Telescope on a 6 day observation campaign that was launched from Kiruna, Sweden to Canada on July 2024.

TuMag is an Imaging spectropolarimeter, that is, takes images at different wavelengths (spectrums) and measures the different polarizations (polarimeter).

TuMag measures the spectrum through an etalon that changes its transmission profile to allow for tuning!

Images from TuMag are wavefront corrected by determined the Zernike coefficients of the wavefront:
